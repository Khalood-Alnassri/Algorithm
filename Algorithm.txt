1. What is Pseudocode?
Pseudocode is an informal, human-readable way of writing the steps of an algorithm or program. It looks like simplified programming language but doesn’t follow the strict rules (syntax) of any real programming language.

2. Why and When Do We Use Pseudocode?
(1)Why do we use pseudocode?
1- To plan the logic of a program before writing actual code.
2- To understand and explain algorithms easily.
3- To avoid syntax errors, since it doesn’t follow strict programming rules.
4- To make problem-solving clear and organized.

(2)When do we use pseudocode?
1- Before coding, to design the solution.
2- During problem analysis, to break a problem into steps.
3- In exams or assignments, to show logical thinking.
4- When explaining programs to others, especially beginners.

3. How to Write Pseudocode to Represent an Algorithm?
(1) Understand the problem clearly: Know what the algorithm should do: the input, process, and output.

(2) Start and end clearly: Use words like START and END to show where the algorithm begins and finishes.

(3) Write steps in simple English: Each step should describe one action, written clearly and briefly.

(4) Use common keywords:
Examples:
- INPUT / READ – to get data.
- OUTPUT / PRINT / DISPLAY – to show results.
- IF / ELSE – for decisions.
- WHILE / FOR – for loops.

(5) Write steps in logical order: The sequence should match how the task is actually performed.

(6) Indent for clarity: Indentation helps show decisions and loops clearly.

(7) Avoid programming syntax: Do not worry about exact rules of any programming language.

2. Algorithm Design Tasks:

(1) Calculate the average of five numbers
START
  READ n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
  average ← (n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 + n5) / 5
  DISPLAY average
END

(2) Check whether a number is even or odd
START
  READ number
  IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN
     DISPLAY "Even"
  ELSE
     DISPLAY "Odd"
  ENDIF
END

(3) Find the Smallest Number in a List:
START
  READ list of numbers
  smallest ← first number in the list

  FOR each number in the list
     IF number < smallest THEN
        smallest ← number
     ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  DISPLAY smallest
END

(4) Count Positive and Negative Numbers:
START
  READ list of numbers
  positiveCount ← 0
  negativeCount ← 0

  FOR each number in the list
     IF number > 0 THEN
        positiveCount ← positiveCount + 1
     ELSE IF number < 0 THEN
        negativeCount ← negativeCount + 1
     ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  DISPLAY positiveCount
  DISPLAY negativeCount
END

(5) Remove Duplicates from a List:
START
  READ list
  uniqueList ← empty list

  FOR each item in list
     IF item is NOT in uniqueList THEN
        ADD item to uniqueList
     ENDIF
  ENDFOR

  DISPLAY uniqueList
END
